    <p>Even though we mostly know of the Vikings as a seafaring people, the majority of the population of Scandinavia during the Viking Age were farmers. The households were usually self-supporting with an economy based on agriculture and animal husbandry. Hunting and fishing surely also contributed substantially to daily housekeeping, as well as gathering seeds from wild edible herbs, roots, berries and nuts.</p>
    <p>Our knowledge of Viking Age cooking is sadly not great. There are no preserved texts with information on this topic available. Maybe they were not preserved, or simply never written down. Thus we do not really know for sure what dishes were cooked. We do however know what raw materials were available, and the tools used for cooking. The recipes on the following pages are reconstructed based on these premises.</p>
