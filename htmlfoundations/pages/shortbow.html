    <title>Archery: Shortbow</title>
</head>

<h1>Shortbow</h1>
<p>
    Shortbows saw little use in classical and medieval Europe, but they were an important weapon in Asia throughout history. The Mongols were especially adept at archery, and they used shortbows throughout the rule of Ghengis Khan in the 13th Century.

    These Mongol bows had elaborate designs. They combined a bamboo core with animal horn on the belly of the bow and sinew on the back of the bow to get the most power for the shortest bow. The only downside was that the animal glue used to hold everything together could easily disintegrate in high humidity or wet weather, ruining the bow.

    The Mongols wanted shortbows because they used them from horseback.

    Mongolian shortbows, also known as horsebows, became popular throughout much of the world thanks to the Mongol Empire. They were used in China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, India, Persia and as far west as Turkey. They were popular clear until the 20th Century when Asian armies began switching to firearms.

    Like longbows, shortbows are no longer any kind of serious tactical weapon. They’re now used almost exclusively by hobbyists. Specifically, people like the dual sport of archery from horseback, also called mounted archery, for which shortbows are ideal. Not only do these archers need incredible bow skills to shoot accurately, they need to be able to ride and control a horse at the same time. It’s quite a sport. Today, it’s most popular in Mongolia, where it saw a revival after Mongolian independence in 1921.

    Some people take mounted archery a step farther and practice mounted bowhunting. Now, generally speaking, mounted bowhunters get off their horses before shooting and can therefore have any model of bow they want. However, the most daring use shortbows and shoot from the saddle.
