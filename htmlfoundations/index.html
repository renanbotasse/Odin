Archery is one of the oldest arts still practised. 
This history will not only take you through a journey on the evolution of archery, but also through the history of mankind. 
Evidence of ancient archery has been found throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p>
References to archery are also frequently made in Greek mythology, in which the story told of Odysseus in Book 21 of the Odyssey is a well-known example.
Odysseus is mentioned as being eminently skilled in the art of archery.

    <p>
Penelope, thinking that her husband will never come back after 20 years of absence, forms a resolution to determine which of her suitors shall receive her hand by shooting with Odysseusâ€™ bow. 
Odysseus, back from the Trojan war and disguised as a shepherd, is the only one able to draw his own bow and shoot an arrow through twelve rings. 
This way he can prove to his wife who he is and defeat all of those who had taken advantage of his long absence.
